The rep contains multiple datasets that I analysed in pyspark and pandas. The purpose was to replicate the pandas pipeline in pyspark for learning pyspark. I thought it might be useful for you as well if you are trying to learn pyspark as someone who knows pandas. 

# I have tried to curate different datasets and have a revelant notebook for each of the datasets:
  
  |  Dataset_Name |Dataset   |NoteBook|   
  |---------------|----------|--------|
  | Cricket_Data_Challenge | [Cricket_Dataset](https://data.world/raghav333/cricket-players-espn) |   |
  |   |   |   | 
  |   |   |   |   
  
  
  
  ## I will keep updating the Notebooks and datasets as I keep learning pyspark. Please star the repo if you found the given learning methodology for pyspark useful or if you found the curated list of datasets useful.
